    "If you are using an iron, preheat it to a temperature of 200-230°C (set to cotton) for about five minutes or until it reaches the desired temperature. If you are using a heat press, set the temperature to 200-230°C and place your patch on the surface of the material.",

  level2:
    "Place a sheet of baking paper or thin fabric over the patch. We recommend using a damp fabric when working with wool or other delicate fabrics. Make sure the fabric is damp but not completely wet.",

  level3:
    "Place the iron on the fabric over the patch and apply constant pressure for about 30 seconds. Allow to cool for five minutes.",

  level4:
    "Turn the fabric upside down and press the area behind the patch, applying pressure for at least 30 seconds. Let the area cool for another five minutes.",

  TO_SEW_text: "This is the traditional method of applying any patch. It requires the use of a needle and thread to sew the patch directly onto the fabric of the garment or item. It can be a laborious process, but it ensures a strong adhesion and greater durability over time. It is usually recommended when dealing with a small quantity of patches to apply or in cases where you want to obtain extremely long-lasting resistance of the application.",
  THERMO_ADHESIVE: "THERMO-ADHESIVE",
  THERMO_ADHESIVE_text: "Some patches may come with a thermal adhesive or iron-on backing. This means that when heated, the adhesive activates and fuses with the fabric, attaching the patch permanently. This method is faster than stitching, but requires the use of a heat press or iron for application. It is a recommended finishing touch when you want to quickly apply a large number of patches, obtaining a quick and long-lasting result.",
