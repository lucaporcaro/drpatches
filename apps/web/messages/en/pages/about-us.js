        "Dr Patches was born from a sincere passion for the art of embroidery. With over four decades of experience in the textile sector, the founders decided to start the Dr Patches project in 2023, motivated by the perception of two main shortcomings within the world of embroidery: the absence of innovation and quality customization. The Dr Patches team creates their works by embroidering exclusively with excellent materials, worked manually by expert craftsmen. Dr Patches aims to offer high quality patches at affordable prices, thus filling a gap in the textile industry landscape.",
